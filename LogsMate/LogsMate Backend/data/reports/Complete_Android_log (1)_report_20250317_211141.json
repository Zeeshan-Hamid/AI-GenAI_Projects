Summary of Anomalies\nAcross the analyzed log chunks, a total of 31 anomalies were detected from 812 log entries. The anomalies are categorized as follows:\n- **INFO**: 8 anomalies (25.81%)\n- **MEDIUM**: 11 anomalies (35.48%)\n- **HIGH**: 8 anomalies (25.81%)\n- **CRITICAL**: 4 anomalies (12.90%)\n\n#### 2. Anomaly Ratios\nThe combined percentage ratios for anomalies categorized by severity are:\n- **INFO**: 25.81%\n- **MEDIUM**: 35.48%\n- **HIGH**: 25.81%\n- **CRITICAL**: 12.90%\n\n#### 3. Root Causes\nSeveral potential root causes for the anomalies have been identified:\n- **Checksum Verification Failures**: Issues detected in critical system files, indicating potential data integrity problems.\n- **Data Corruption**: Corruption in SIM configuration files, which can lead to system instability.\n- **Resource Contention**: IOException encountered during surface destruction and notification cancellation due to resource contention and stream closures.\n- **Permission Issues**: SecurityException due to permission denials, affecting access to sensitive data.\n- **Native Crashes**: Crashes in native libraries, indicating potential system instability.\n- **Screen Freezing Issues**: Screen freezing issues affecting user experience.\n- **Notification Delivery Failures**: Issues with lock release leading to notification delivery failures and UI lag.\n\n#### 4. System Health Assessment\nBased on the aggregated data, the overall system health is assessed as **Degraded**. The presence of critical anomalies such as data corruption, checksum verification failures, and native crashes indicates significant issues that need immediate attention.\n\n#### 5. Actionable Insights\nTo improve the system, the following recommendations are provided:\n- **Investigate Checksum Verification Failures**: Ensure system file integrity by resolving checksum verification issues.\n- **Address Data Corruption**: Prevent system instability by addressing data corruption in SIM configuration.\n- **Optimize Resource Management**: Avoid IOException by optimizing resource management during surface destruction and notification cancellation.\n- **Review Permission Settings**: Correct permission settings to prevent SecurityException.\n- **Analyze Native Crashes**: Identify and fix underlying issues in native libraries causing crashes.\n- **Monitor Screen Freezing Issues**: Enhance user experience by addressing screen freezing issues.\n- **Ensure Proper Lock Management**: Prevent notification delivery failures and UI lag by ensuring proper lock management.\n\nThis structured report and recommendations aim to guide the resolution of detected anomalies and improve overall system stability and performance.",
